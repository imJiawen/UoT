From your description, it seems that the gastroscopy examination confirmed the presence of gastritis, likely caused by excessive alcohol consumption, which has damaged the esophagus and stomach. I preliminarily diagnose you with reflux esophagitis, and recommend taking oral omeprazole, mosapride, and sucralfate for observation. The treatment course for reflux esophagitis is 6-8 weeks, with omeprazole taken for 2 months, and mosapride and sucralfate taken for 1-2 weeks. The medication may be adjusted based on symptoms. Pay attention to your diet. Additionally, please note the following: 1. Do not lie down immediately after eating during the day, do not eat within 2 hours before bedtime, and elevate the head of your bed by 15-20cm. 2. Reduce factors that increase abdominal pressure: obesity, constipation, tight waistbands, avoid foods that relax the lower esophageal sphincter (high-fat foods, chocolate, coffee, strong tea), and avoid medications that relax the lower esophageal sphincter (nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergic drugs). 3.

Have you had thyroid function tests done? Your current situation requires thyroid function tests to rule out hyperthyroidism, as well as a colonoscopy to rule out conditions such as colon ulcers, polyps, and tumors. Irritable bowel syndrome is a problem with regulating intestinal function, so it can recur. Symptoms typically include constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or a combination of these. Various factors, including emotions such as anger, depression, anxiety, and stress, can trigger it; staying up late, fatigue, and certain foods like alcohol, spicy, and cold foods can also trigger it; exposure to cold can also trigger it; insomnia, excessive worrying, and stress can also cause this condition to recur. The diagnosis of the disease must rule out organic diseases such as ulcers, tumors, polyps, and hyperthyroidism. In today's environment where colon tumors are becoming increasingly common among young people, it is recommended that both young and elderly individuals undergo a colonoscopy to rule out organic diseases before considering this diagnosis. If you have had thyroid function tests done, ruled out hyperthyroidism, and had a colonoscopy with no issues, and the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is relatively clear, the following treatments can be considered: removing triggers, avoiding spicy and cold foods, and taking medication.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a problem with the regulation of intestinal function, so it can recur. Usually, symptoms manifest as constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or a combination of these three symptoms appearing simultaneously or intermittently. However, various factors, including emotions such as anger, depression, anxiety, and stress, can trigger it; staying up late, fatigue, and certain foods like alcohol, spicy, and cold foods can also trigger it; exposure to cold can also easily trigger it; insomnia, excessive worrying, overthinking, and high stress can also cause this condition to recur. The diagnosis of the disease must rule out organic diseases, such as ulcers, tumors, polyps, hyperthyroidism, and so on. In today's environment where colorectal cancer is becoming increasingly common among young people, it is recommended that both young and elderly individuals undergo a colonoscopy to rule out organic diseases before considering this diagnosis. If you have had a colonoscopy and there are no issues, and the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is relatively clear, the following treatments can be considered: removing triggers, avoiding spicy and cold foods, and taking medication. Medications that can be taken include mebeverine tablets, three times a day, one tablet each time (50mg); and peppermint oil capsules, twice a day, two capsules each time (420mg). Removing triggers is the most crucial aspect of treatment.\nPatients: Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Your condition may be constipation. The hard lump in your abdomen is likely caused by a buildup of feces.\nPatients: How should that be handled?\nDoctor: Before giving birth, were there any similar situations?\nPatients: No.\nDoctor: That is caused by irregular diet and sleep patterns after giving birth.\nPatients: Do you need to take medicine?\nDoctor: It is best not to take medication for treatment, firstly because medication during lactation needs to be cautious, and secondly to avoid dependency. Methods for preventing constipation include: 1. Develop a good habit of regular bowel movements, such as going to the bathroom in the morning, after breakfast, or before going to bed, regardless of whether you feel the urge to go or not. Over time, this will help establish a regular bowel movement routine. 2. Pay attention to a balanced diet, eat more green leafy vegetables and fruits rich in fiber. 3. Engage in light physical activities to promote intestinal movement, shorten the time food stays in the intestines, and increase the amount of bowel movements. 4. Drink a glass of warm water or plain water on an empty stomach every morning to stimulate intestinal peristalsis, which helps with bowel movements. 5.

If you eat and drink less, it can lead to dry stools and constipation, which is not conducive to your weight loss! In addition, chili peppers can also cause dry stools and even lead to bleeding hemorrhoids, so you must stop consuming them recently. As for the reason for your current bleeding, I think there are two possibilities that are more likely. One is that dry stools cause local mucosal damage around the anus, leading to bleeding, and the other is that there may be hemorrhoids, especially internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, I suggest that you control your diet recently, keep your stools moist and smooth, and see if there is still bleeding. If there is repeated bleeding, you need to have a proctology examination to determine the location and cause of the bleeding.\nPatients: Okay, thank you teacher.\nDoctor: You're welcome, feel free to contact me if you have any further questions!
